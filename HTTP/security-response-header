#######################################
HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) :
#######################################
== The HTTP Strict Transport Security header informs the browser that it should never load a site using HTTP 
   and should automatically convert all attempts to access the site using HTTP to HTTPS requests instead.
  ```
   Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time> [; includeSubDomains]
  ```
@ max-age=<expire-time>:
  The time, in seconds, that the browser should remember that a site is only to be accessed using HTTPS.
@ includeSubDomains:
  If this optional parameter is specified, this rule applies to all of the site's subdomains as well.
== BENEFIT:
  1. against HTTP downgrade attacks (SSL stripping attacks) 
  2. against Man-in-the-middle(MITM) attacks
  3. ensures all communication is encrypted and all sent 
  and received responses are delivered to – and received from – the authenticated server.
 
 
#######################################
X-Frame-Options :
#######################################
== The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should 
   be allowed to render this page (which responses this header) in a <frame>, <iframe> or <object> . 
  ```
    X-Frame-Options: DENY
    X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
    X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM url
  ```
@ DENY
  The page cannot be displayed in a frame.
@ SAMEORIGIN
  The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself.
@ ALLOW-FROM uri
  The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin.
== BENEFIT:
  Sites can use this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.


#######################################
X-XSS-Protection :
#######################################
== The HTTP X-XSS-Protection response header is a feature of Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari (**except Firefox**)
   that stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. 
  ```
    X-XSS-Protection: 0
    X-XSS-Protection: 1
    X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
    X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=<reporting-uri>
  ```
@ 0
  Disables XSS filtering.
@ 1
  Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). 
  If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts).
@ 1; mode=block
  Enables XSS filtering. 
  Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected.
@ 1; report=<reporting-URI>  (Chromium only)
  Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation.
 
 
#######################################
X-Content-Type-Options :
#######################################
== prevent the browser from interpreting files as something else than declared by the content type in the HTTP headers
  ```
   X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  ```
@ nosniff
   Blocks a request if the requested type is
   "style" and the MIME type is not "text/css", or
   "script" and the MIME type is not a JavaScript MIME type.


#######################################
Referrer-Policy :
#######################################
== The Referrer-Policy HTTP header governs which referrer information, sent in the Referer header, 
   should be included with requests made.
  ```
   Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
   Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade
   Referrer-Policy: origin
   Referrer-Policy: origin-when-cross-origin
   Referrer-Policy: same-origin
   Referrer-Policy: strict-origin
   Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
   Referrer-Policy: unsafe-url
  ```
@ no-referrer
   No referrer information is sent along with requests.
@ no-referrer-when-downgrade **(default)**
   The origin is sent as a referrer when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS->HTTPS), 
   but isn't sent to a less secure destination (HTTPS->HTTP).
@ origin 
   Only send the origin of the document as the referrer in all cases.
   For Example:
      Document:         https://example.com/page.html	
      Navigation to:    any domain or path	
      Referrer:         https://example.com/
@ origin-when-cross-origin
   Send a full URL when performing a same-origin request, but only send the origin of the document for other cases.
@ same-origin
   A referrer will be sent for same-site origins, but cross-origin requests will contain no referrer information.
@ strict-origin
   Only send the origin of the document as the referrer to a-priori as-much-secure destination (HTTPS->HTTPS), 
   but don't send it to a less secure destination (HTTPS->HTTP).
@ strict-origin-when-cross-origin
   Send a full URL when performing a same-origin request, only send the origin of the document 
   to a-priori as-much-secure destination (HTTPS->HTTPS), and send no header to a less secure destination (HTTPS->HTTP).
@ unsafe-url
   Send a full URL when performing a same-origin or cross-origin request.
