HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) :
#######################################
== The HTTP Strict Transport Security header informs the browser that it should never load a site using HTTP 
  and should automatically convert all attempts to access the site using HTTP to HTTPS requests instead.
  ```
   Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time> [; includeSubDomains]
  ```
@ max-age=<expire-time>:
  The time, in seconds, that the browser should remember that a site is only to be accessed using HTTPS.
@ includeSubDomains:
  If this optional parameter is specified, this rule applies to all of the site's subdomains as well.
== BENIFIT:
  1. against HTTP downgrade attacks (SSL stripping attacks) 
  2. against Man-in-the-middle(MITM) attacks
  3. ensures all communication is encrypted and all sent 
  and received responses are delivered to – and received from – the authenticated server.
